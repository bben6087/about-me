My name is Blake Bennett. I am in Section 02 and Dr. Case in my instructor for the course.

I am a junior here at Northwest and I am pursuing a General B.S. Computer Science degree. I will be graduating in the spring of 2022.

Just a little information about me and my background is I am from Kansas City, Missouri and some of my hobbies include golf, soccer, fishing, and video games.

For my career I would like to work as a software developer at a company somewhere in Kansas City. As of right now I am looking for an internship for next summer in Kansas City and will hopefully get one soon.

Something interesting that not many people know about me is I am very fascinated by history and government. If I did not have such an interest in computer science I would have probably majored in political science.
